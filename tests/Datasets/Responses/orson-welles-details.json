  "biography": "George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985), best known as Orson Welles, was an American film director, actor, theatre director, screenwriter, and producer, who worked extensively in film, theatre, television and radio. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work—despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"\n\nAfter directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965), and F for Fake (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.\n\nIn 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968 included him in the \"pantheon\" of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.",

As such, it compared end-time prophecies in the Bible with then-current events in an attempt to broadly predict future scenarios leading to the rapture of believers before the tribulation and Second Coming of Christ to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) Kingdom on Earth.",

Nor is it pulled from an academic treatise on the phenomenologies of post-industrial existence. This statement was made by Orson Welles in the 1972 futurist documentary Future Shock, and, unlike some of the more dated elements of 1970s educational films, Future Shock remains shockingly current in verbalizing the concerns and anxieties that come along with rapid societal and technological change.

A despondent and suicidal Mary Bailey Hatch is praying for guidance on what to do about an incident no fault of her own which threatens her name and the community standing of her longtime family business, the Bailey Building and Loan, which she took over after the passing of her father. What Mary does not know is that most in town, including her husband George Hatch and their children, are also praying for her. All the prayers are heard by Joseph, God's gatekeeper of prayers. As there are no other angels available on such a busy day, Joseph assigns Clara Oddbody, angel second class (i.e. she has yet to receive her wings), to Mary's case, which he reluctantly does as Clara has never been assigned a case on her own in the two hundred years she's been in heaven for good reason.",

Others leave the same door and walk down the same stairs: a shabby man, a cop, and, several times, the same dandy. The man in blackface hangs himself; the dandy continues to smile. A bell tolls, a grave beckons. In the dark, the dandy plays the piano. Is he Death? The Hearts of Age is the first film made by Orson Welles. The film is an eight-minute short, which he co-directed with William Vance in 1934. The film stars Welles' first wife, Virginia Nicholson, as well as Welles himself. He made the film while attending the Todd School for Boys, in Woodstock, Illinois, at the age of 19.",

The film consists of readings by Welles from the book Moby Dick, shot against a blue background with various optical illusions to give the impression of being at sea. It was made during a break in the filming of The Other Side of the Wind. There is some ambiguity about what Welles intended to do with the footage, and how he was going to compile it. It remained unedited in his lifetime.",

Graver observed, \"A lot of people were there in the audience that day who are successful filmmakers now\", as well as several noted film critics such as Joseph McBride and Todd McCarthy. However, Welles never got round to editing the raw footage. Its only use in Welles' lifetime was by BBC journalist Leslie Megahy for his 1982 Arena documentary on Welles. The documentary features a young man asking Welles whether he would agree he has been persecuted by The Establishment and the capitalist system, and Welles being somewhat bemused by the question.",

In 2003, the Munich cinémathèque museum restored the film, which  narrates a Ring Lardner short story. The missing parts were filled in from a radio play recorded in 1946.",

The local chief of police savagely beat him, leaving him unconscious and permanently blind. The shocking incident made national headlines and, when the police chief was acquitted by an all-white jury, the blatant injustice would change the course of American history. Based on Richard Gergel’s book Unexampled Courage, the film details how the crime led to the racial awakening of President Harry Truman, who desegregated federal offices and the military two years later. The event also ultimately set the stage for the Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which finally outlawed segregation in public schools and jumpstarted the modern civil rights movement.",

The event, for which ticket-buyers paid up to $1,000 a seat (tax-deductible as a contribution to the Actors' Fund) was billed as \"The Night of 100 Stars\" but, actually, around 230 stars took part. And most of the audience of 5,800 had no idea in advance that they were paying to see a TV taping, complete with long waits for set and costume changes, tape rewinding, and the like.  Executive producer Alexander Cohen estimated that the 5,800 Radio City Music Hall seats sold out at prices ranging from $25 to $1,000. The show itself cost about $4 million to produce and was expected to yield around $2 million for the new addition to the Actors Fund retirement home in Englewood, N. J.  ABC is reputed to have paid more than $5 million for the television rights.",

From 1954 onward, all of its productions have been shown in color, although color television video productions were extremely rare in 1954. Many television movies have been shown on the program since its debut, though the program began with live telecasts of dramas and then changed to videotaped productions before finally changing to filmed ones.\n\nThe series has received eighty Emmy Awards, twenty-four Christopher Awards, eleven Peabody Awards, nine Golden Globes, and four Humanitas Prizes. Once a common practice in American television, it is the last remaining television program such that the title includes the name of the sponsor. Unlike other long-running TV series still on the air, it differs in that it broadcasts only occasionally and not on a weekly broadcast programming schedule.",

For a series of 54 specials and shows, Martin would periodically \"roast\" a celebrity. These roasts were patterned after the roasts held at the New York Friars' Club in New York City. The format would have the celebrity guest seated at a banquet table, and one by one the guest of honor was affectionately chided or insulted about his career by his fellow celebrity friends.\n\nIn 1973, The Dean Martin Show was declining in popularity. The final season of his variety show would be retooled into one of celebrity roasts, requiring less of Martin's involvement. For the 1973–1974 season, a new feature called “Man of the Week Celebrity Roast\" was added to try to pick up the ratings. The roasts seemed to be popular among television audiences and are often marketed in post-issues as part of the official Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts and not The Dean Martin Show. After The Dean Martin Show was cancelled in 1974, NBC drew up a contract with Martin to do several specials and do more roast specials. Starting with Bob Hope in 1974, the roast was taped in California and turned out to be a hit, leading to many other roasts to follow.",

The film is an eight-minute short, which he co-directed with William Vance in 1934. The film stars Welles' first wife, Virginia Nicholson, as well as Welles himself. He made the film while attending the Todd School for Boys, in Woodstock, Illinois, at the age of 19.",

It was made during a break in the filming of The Other Side of the Wind. There is some ambiguity about what Welles intended to do with the footage, and how he was going to compile it.

The contract signed in March 1955 with ITV called for an order of 26 episodes, each to be a travelogue. This is Welles' first real work for television (the \"Sketch Book\" series consists of long fixed shots in the studio). The episode filmed first is the one dedicated to Vienna. Two episodes are devoted to the Basque Country, another to bullfighting, then to a district of Paris, Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and finally, the last to retirees from Chelsea (London). The episode dedicated to the Domenici Affair was left partly unfinished, but should have been the first documentary dedicated to this affair which hit the headlines in France in 1952.",

This was abandoned in 1969 when CBS withdrew its funding over Welles' long-running disputes with US authorities regarding his tax status, and Welles continued to fashion the footage in his own style.",

The contract signed in March 1955 with ITV called for an order of 26 episodes, each to be a travelogue. This is Welles' first real work for television (the \"Sketch Book\" series consists of long fixed shots in the studio). The episode filmed first is the one dedicated to Vienna. Two episodes are devoted to the Basque Country, another to bullfighting, then to a district of Paris, Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and finally, the last to retirees from Chelsea (London). The episode dedicated to the Domenici Affair was left partly unfinished, but should have been the first documentary dedicated to this affair which hit the headlines in France in 1952.",

The contract signed in March 1955 with ITV called for an order of 26 episodes, each to be a travelogue. This is Welles' first real work for television (the \"Sketch Book\" series consists of long fixed shots in the studio). The episode filmed first is the one dedicated to Vienna. Two episodes are devoted to the Basque Country, another to bullfighting, then to a district of Paris, Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and finally, the last to retirees from Chelsea (London). The episode dedicated to the Domenici Affair was left partly unfinished, but should have been the first documentary dedicated to this affair which hit the headlines in France in 1952.",

          "biography": "George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985), best known as Orson Welles, was an American film director, actor, theatre director, screenwriter, and producer, who worked extensively in film, theatre, television and radio. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work—despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"\n\nAfter directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965), and F for Fake (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.\n\nIn 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968 included him in the \"pantheon\" of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.",

          "biography": "Американский кинорежиссер, актер, сценарист и продюсер. В 1999 году был включен в список «100 величайших звезд кино». В 15 лет Уэллс начал играть в театре, а в 1934 году стал полноправным участником коллектива Федерального театра. В этом же году он женится на начинающей актрисе Вирджинии Николсон, брак с которой трудно назвать удачным. В 1937 году к Уэллсу приходит настоящая слава - он вместе с продюсером Хаусманом создает свою антрепризу «Меркьюри-тиэтр», их труппа начинает выступать еженедельно по радио со своими предельно реалистичными спектаклями. В 1941 году 25-летний режиссер Орсон Уэллс создает первый фильм для компании «РКО-рэдио пикчерз» - «Гражданин Кейн». Несмотря на то, что прибыли эта работа не принесла, по мнению специалистов, она оказала существенное влияние на развитие звукового кинематографа. Далее у режиссера следуют ленты «Великолепные Эмберсоны» (1942) и «Чужестранец» (1946). Но, несмотря на признание критиков и молодой еще тогда Киноакадемии, картины плохо идут в прокате. Уэллс и «РКО-рэдио пикчерз» расторгают контракт, и режиссер заключает выгодное соглашение с Columbia Pictures, где снимает один из лучших своих фильмов - «Леди из Шанхая» (1947). Картина имела огромный успех в Европе, что во многом и обусловило переезд Орсона на другой континент, где его творчество не только любили критики, но и хорошо принимали зрители. После переезда в Старый Свеи Орсон Уэллс много снимает и снимается сам, участвует в радиопостановках и появляется на телевидении. Его жизнь была насыщенной и плодотворной вплоть до самой кончины в возрасте 70 лет от сердечного приступа в своем собственном доме в Голливуде",

          "biography": "George Orson Welles, simplement appelé Orson Welles, est un artiste américain, à la fois acteur, réalisateur, producteur et scénariste, mais également metteur en scène de théâtre, dessinateur, écrivain et illusionniste, né le 6 mai 1915 à Kenosha (Wisconsin) et mort le 10 octobre 1985 à Hollywood (Californie).\n\nIl a été parfois crédité sous les noms de O. W. Jeeves ou G. O. Spelvi2.\n\nD'abord révélé à lui-même par le théâtre de Shakespeare, puis rendu célèbre par une émission de radio (La Guerre des mondes), Orson Welles devient une figure incontournable du cinéma avec son premier long-métrage, Citizen Kane (1941), que l'ensemble des critiques considère comme l’un des films les plus importants du XXe siècle.\n\nPar la suite, son style cinématographique, mais aussi son jeu d'acteur, exercent une grande influence sur le cinéma des années 1950-1970, en particulier sur Stanley Kubrick. Artiste précoce et polymorphe, farouchement épris de son indépendance, amateur de cigares, de tauromachie et d'illusionnisme, Welles ne cesse tout au long de sa carrière de revenir au théâtre et à la littérature, aux grands textes classiques (Othello, Don Quichotte) comme aux contemporains (Le Procès). Se défiant du système de production et entretenant sa propre légende d'effets à la fois spectaculaires et énigmatiques, il laisse de nombreux films inachevés.\n\nSon père, Richard Heard Welles, est un industriel dilettante et un grand voyageur; sa mère, Béatrice Welles née Ives, est pianiste. Le fils les décrit ainsi: «Mon père était un bon vivant de l'époque édouardienne qui aimait se dire inventeur. Il était généreux et tolérant, adoré de tous ses amis. Je lui dois une enfance privilégiée et l'amour des voyages. Ma mère était une femme d'une beauté mémorable, elle s'occupait de politique, était championne de tir au fusil, ainsi que pianiste de concert très douée. Je tiens d'elle l'amour de la musique et de l'éloquence sans lesquels aucun être humain n'est complet».\n\nLe jeune Orson grandit dans une ambiance raffinée et cultivée avec une touche d'excentricité. Les témoignages sur sa précocité abondent: il sait lire à deux ans, apprend à jouer du piano à trois ans et met en scène des pièces de Shakespeare à sept ans. La légende, difficile à démêler de la réalité, veut en effet qu'il ait été un enfant prodige et qu'il ait joué Le Roi Lear tout seul à l'âge de sept ans et accompli d'autres exploits avant cela. Ces «exploits» sont désormais connus: il fait à trois ans une apparition dans Samson et Dalila à l'Opéra de Chicago, puis plus tard dans Madame Butterfly.\n\nEn 1919, ses parents se séparent et Orson suit sa mère à Chicago. À dix ans, il interprète Peter Rabbit dans les locaux du centre commercial Marshall Field's à Chicago. Par la suite, le journal local lui consacre un article titré: «Dessinateur, acteur, poète; il n'a que dix ans». Ses aptitudes et sa passion pour le monde du spectacle ne s'arrêtent pas là: il se veut également décorateur, metteur-en-scène et surtout comédien, et ce qu'il préfère avant tout sont le transformisme et les postiches. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Orson Welles\" de Wikipédia en français, soumis à la licence CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
