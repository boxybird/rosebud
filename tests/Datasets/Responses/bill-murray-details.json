  "biography": "William James Murray (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He is known for his deadpan delivery in roles ranging from studio comedies to independent dramas. He has frequently collaborated with directors Ivan Reitman, Harold Ramis, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Jim Jarmusch. He has earned numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and two Independent Spirit Awards, as well as a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2016, Murray was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\nMurray was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille (1921–1988), a mail-room clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II (1921–1967), a lumber salesman. He was raised in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Murray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors.\n\nMurray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, where he studied pre-med for a year. He dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. In 1973, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in comedy. He joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour, and later appeared in the National Lampoon stage show Lemmings.\n\nIn 1977, Murray joined the cast of Saturday Night Live. He quickly became one of the show's most popular cast members, known for his deadpan delivery and his ability to improvise. He left the show in 1980 to pursue a film career.\n\nMurray's first major film role was in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. He went on to star in a number of successful comedies, including Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984), and Groundhog Day (1993). He has also starred in a number of critically acclaimed dramas, such as Lost in Translation (2003) and Broken Flowers (2005).\n\nMurray is known for his eccentric and unpredictable behavior. He has been known to disappear from sets and film projects, and he has often been quoted as saying that he doesn't like to work. However, he is also known for his generosity and his willingness to help out his fellow actors.",

He interviews many of the game’s great champions and more than a few colorful characters, who are asked the question, “What is the spirit of golf?” We hear from Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, the wonderfully unique Moe Norman, Kathy Whitworth and Nancy Lopez, and notable teachers such as David Leadbetter, “Butch” Harmon and commentators Herbert Warren Wind, Jack Whitaker, and Jim Nantz. All the answers are marvelously diverse, funny, and poetic… just like the game itself.",

Although the film \"Groundhog Day\" was published a quarter of a century ago, the cult surrounding the American improvisational talent has never died down and is now becoming almost irrational. The documentary, peppered with interviews from companions and confidants, follows in Murray's footsteps and tries to fathom where the unique fascination for this man comes from. Starting with the theater in his hometown of Chicago, to the TV shows of the satirical magazine \"National Lampoon\" and the legendary comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" to his checkered film career.",

The Chairman is portrayed by actor and martial artist Mark Dacascos, who is introduced as the nephew of the original Japanese chairman Takeshi Kaga.

The music is written by composer Craig Marks, who released the soundtrack titled \"Iron Chef America & The Next Iron Chef\" by the end of 2010.

        "overview": "Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell is an American television comedy-variety program that ran on ABC from September 1975 to January 1976, hosted by Howard Cosell and executive-produced by Roone Arledge. The series ran for 18 episodes before being cancelled.  Despite having highly notable celebrities both as cast members and guests, Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell has never been made available on home video.\n\nSaturday Night Live with Howard Cosell should not be confused with the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, which debuted on rival network NBC in October 1975 when NBC began airing a late night comedy show produced by Lorne Michaels titled NBC's Saturday Night. After Cosell's show was cancelled, the NBC show renamed itself Saturday Night Live. The shows did not directly compete, as Cosell's Saturday Night Live aired at 8 p.m. EST/PST, whereas NBC's Saturday Night aired at 11:30 p.m.",

          "biography": "William James Murray (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He is known for his deadpan delivery in roles ranging from studio comedies to independent dramas. He has frequently collaborated with directors Ivan Reitman, Harold Ramis, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Jim Jarmusch. He has earned numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and two Independent Spirit Awards, as well as a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2016, Murray was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\nMurray was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille (1921–1988), a mail-room clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II (1921–1967), a lumber salesman. He was raised in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Murray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors.\n\nMurray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, where he studied pre-med for a year. He dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. In 1973, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in comedy. He joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour, and later appeared in the National Lampoon stage show Lemmings.\n\nIn 1977, Murray joined the cast of Saturday Night Live. He quickly became one of the show's most popular cast members, known for his deadpan delivery and his ability to improvise. He left the show in 1980 to pursue a film career.\n\nMurray's first major film role was in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. He went on to star in a number of successful comedies, including Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984), and Groundhog Day (1993). He has also starred in a number of critically acclaimed dramas, such as Lost in Translation (2003) and Broken Flowers (2005).\n\nMurray is known for his eccentric and unpredictable behavior. He has been known to disappear from sets and film projects, and he has often been quoted as saying that he doesn't like to work. However, he is also known for his generosity and his willingness to help out his fellow actors.",

          "biography": "Seus pais eram de classe pobre e tiveram nove filhos. Para poder pagar o colégio, a maioria dos irmãos trabalhou como caddies em um clube de golfe. No colégio, Murray se iniciou na interpretação teatral. Posteriormente, ele se inscreveu na Universidade de Denver, mas pouco tempo depois foi expulso por porte de maconha.Murray decidiu, então, tentar a sorte no rádio. Ele apresentou um programa que não teve sucesso, sendo retirado do ar poucos meses depois, mas participou da continuação de outro que foi emitido por mais tempo. Em 1977, depois de trabalhar em uma companhia de teatro de Chicago, Murray foi contratado por um programa ao vivo de televisão muito popular, o Saturday Night Live, e teve seu início cinematográfico em 1979 no filme canadense \"Almôndegas\", de Ivan Reitman, no qual Murray faz o papel de um monitor em um acampamento de verão pra jovens. Ele estrelou vários outros filme, até que em 1984 teve seu grande sucesso de bilheteria com \"Os Caça-fantasmas\", filme também dirigido por Ivan Reitman, com o qual Murray tinha uma ótima sintonia e com o qual trabalhou em inúmeras ocasiões.A partir de então, Murray tornou-se um ator consagrado, principalmente no gênero cômico. Não obstante, teve o desejo de interpretar também personagens mais sérios, e o fez em algumas ocasiões, como no filme \"Uma Mulher para Dois\", de 1993, com Robert De Niro e Uma Thurman. No mesmo ano estrelou \"Feitiço do Tempo\", com Andie MacDowell, outro de seus grandes sucessos. Pelo seu papel como protagonista em \"Encontros e Desencontros\", de Sofia Coppola, ganhou o Globo de Ouro em 2004 como Melhor Ator (filme de comédia ou musical).Murray se casou duas vezes, a primeira em 1981. Este matrimônio durou três anos. Em 1997, Murray se casou pela segunda vez. Ele tem dois filhos de sua primeira esposa e três da segunda.\n\nCônjuge: Jennifer Butler (de 1997 a 2008), Margaret Kelly (de 1981 a 1996)\n\nIrmãos: Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray, John Murray\n\nFilhos: Luke Murray, Homer Murray, Cooper Murray, Cal Murray, Jackson Murray, Lincoln Murra",

          "biography": "Білл Мюррей — американський кіноактор.\n\nНародився в місті Еванстон і виріс у Вілметті (Іллінойс, США). Він був п’ятим з дев’яти дітей у сім’ї ірландських католиків Едварда Мюррея та Люсіль Дойл. Троє його братів — Джон Мюррей, Джоель Мюррей і Браян Дойл-Мюррей — також є акторами.\n\nБатьки-ірландці віддали дітей до єзуїтської школи, однак навчання Мюррея практично не вабило. Набагато цікавіше було битися з однокласниками, малювати карикатури на вчителів, грати в шкільному театрі і задивлятися на дівчат, які там виступали. Становище не змінилось і тоді, коли Мюррей вступив до медичного коледжу в Колорадо. Білл практично не бував на заняттях, вживав марихуану і нерідко ночував у поліцейському відділку. А чого тільки варта його витівка у Денверському аеропорту, коли він вирішив пожартувати і заявив, що в його багажі захована бомба. Охорона поспішила обшукати Мюррея, але замість бомби виявила марихуану. Після цього випадку Білла виключили з коледжу. Мюррей повернувся до Чикаго, де деякий час перебивався випадковими заробітками, поки не потрапив до знаменитої чикаґської акторської студії — Second City.\n\nНезабаром Мюрреєві запропонували стати одним з ведучих шоу «Суботнім вечором у прямому ефірі». Ця передача завоювала таку популярність, що Мюррея запросили до Голлівуду. Першим успіхом актора можна вважати роль другого плану у відомій комедії «Тутсі», після якої про Мюррея заговорили критики. А вже у 1984 році, знявшись у фантастичній комедії «Мисливці на привидів», Мюррей піднісся на саму вершину голлівудського Олімпу.\n\nУспіх мали і наступні картини за участю Мюррея, а комедія «День бабака» набула статусу культової. Мюррею блискуче вдався образ злегка втомленої від життя, іронічної і навіть цинічної, але в глибині душі доброї і порядної людини. Цей фільм закріпив за Мюрреєм репутацію одного з найталановитіших американських коміків. У той же час після «Дня бабака» у кар’єрі Мюррея настав спад: наступні п’ять років у нього практично не було цікавих ролей.\n\nУ кінці 90-х у кар’єрі Мюррея почався новий етап: він почав виконувати драматичні ролі у незалежному американському кіно, знімаючись у таких режисерів, як Вес Андерсон («Академія Рашмор», «Водне життя зі Стівом Зіссу») і Джим Джармуш («Кава та сигарети», «Зламані квіти»). Особливо слід відзначити психологічну мелодраму «Труднощі перекладу» про взаємини двох самотніх американців — дорослого чоловіка (якого, власне кажучи, і зіграв Мюррей) і молодої дівчини (цю роль зіграла Скарлетт Йогансон), які опинилися в чужій для них Японії. Ця роль принесла Біллові «Золотий глобус» і номінацію на «Оскар».",
